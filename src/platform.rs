    // On windows opening the file to get size, file ID and volume can be very
    // expensive because 1) it causes a few system calls, and more importantly 2) it can cause
    // windows defender to scan the file.
    // Therefore we try to avoid doing that for common cases, mainly those of
    // plain files:

    // The idea is to make do with the file size that we get from the OS for
    // free as part of iterating a folder. Therefore we want to make sure that
    // it makes sense to use that free size information:

    // Volume boundaries:
    // The user can ask us not to cross volume boundaries. If the DirEntry is a
    // plain file and not a reparse point or other non-trivial stuff, we assume
    // that the file is located on the same volume as the directory that
    // contains it.

    // File ID:
    // This optimization does deprive us of access to a file ID. As a
    // workaround, we just make one up that hopefully does not collide with real
    // file IDs.
    // Hard links: Unresolved. We don't get inode/file index, so hard links
    // count once for each link. Hopefully they are not too commonly in use on
    // windows.

    // Size:
    // We assume (naively?) that for the common cases the free size info is the
    // same as one would get by doing the expensive thing. Sparse, encrypted and
    // compressed files are not included in the common cases, as one can image
    // there being more than view on their size.

    // Savings in orders of magnitude in terms of time, io and cpu have been
    // observed on hdd, windows 10, some 100Ks files taking up some hundreds of
    // GBs:
    // Consistently opening the file: 30 minutes.
    // With this optimization:         8 sec.
